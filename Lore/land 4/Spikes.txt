_- Don Spikes - _

Head of the Bebop family
Located in the infamous Kingdom of Hearts(KoH)

Bio:
  Spikes is known throughout all of Mano di Morde for his achievements and
power, but almost none know him personally. He is a man, who has a tight
circle of people around him, whom he opens to with ease. Even Tulio does
not know much of Spikes` personal life. His henchmen, except the people in 
his closest circle, have never even seen him. They recieve his word, through
another member who is close enough to speak with the infamous man.
(Usually Dons and rarely capos of the Bebop Family - NOT MANO.)
So he is like a legend - shrouded in mystery. Some even 
question if such a person exists - a man with so much achievements and 
power - it could be a fiction to keep order in such a powerful place(KoH)...
He is described to be a very, very serious man, always having a serious
expression. He despises the opposite sex, he viewes and treats women as
lesser beings and treasures the code of Omerta, which is a requirement 
for any member/associate to follow. The only time other dons of Mano di Morde
or anyone outside his family is able to see him is at the Mano di Morde meetings.
