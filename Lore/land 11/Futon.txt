_- Don Futon -_

Head of the iTron family
Located in OASIS
(Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation)

Bio:
  Futon lives in the computer simulated reality of OASIS, made up of many 
different planets and worlds, which have different purposes and amenities.
He was always a genious when it comes to technology and mechanisms.
Much like any famous genious he was abit crazy with impressive
incomprehensable logic, that noone understands, yet it always brings him the
right answers. He never quite understood the concept of magic so he didn`t
fancy it much. A very short man with a crazy looking haircut and fancy
clothes with strange gadgets here and there. That was Futon.
  When Mano di Morde was still a small family controling only two lands,
Tulio set his sight on Futon and the vast land(or space) he lived in. After all
word had it that Futon was the smartest person among the living. So it took
Tulio a few years of confrontations with Futon and some well known groups
of the land, before he managed to call it his own. In the end those groups
were dispatched and Futon had decided he was sick of all the senseless
fighting and that he didn`t mind to have the peace Tulio offered under the
name of Mano di Morde. Even more so, Futon adored the idea of being
"Head of the science division" of Mano di Morde and head of the newborn
iTron family which ruled over the land he grew up in. Futon already knew
absolutely everything OASIS offered him as information, so the position 
granting him access to all the unknown tech anyone of the family finds was 
like a dream come true. After all there was no grater happiness for Futon 
than sudying a new mechanism.
