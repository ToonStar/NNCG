===========
Spies of Mano di Morde say that there seem to be more lands, but for now
Godfather Tulio has forbidden this intelligence from reaching the heads of 
the other lands/families. Families that do know of this are Don Spikes's, Don  Twinx's and Don Mano's.
They and mostly Godfather Tulio will decide when it's time to share this intelligence with the rest.
20th land is forbidden from any action or recon due to possession of technology far too advanced and dangerous.

Honorary mentions whom each member should know and KNOWS, due to them being written on the rules they signed & vowed upon:
- Spikes, for doing the impossible!
- Mano..... name says it all.
- Guavanni. You know why... you fluffy bear you!
- Futon, for science, science... and SCIENCE!
- Twinx for being the sexiest woman in the planet!*

*Written by the Pekalda boys - rawr! :)

All of these mentions have been reviewed by the Godfather himself, so if you
are confused or got a problem with one, be my guest and knock on his door..
