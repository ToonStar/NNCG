In the newly conquered land, Terraria, a big meeting was taking place.
The room was filled with dons from all around the world. One of which was Don Toon. 
He sat on his chair next to the other Dons. 
Next to him was Don Futon and on his other side was Don Fruzier. He shook hands with both of them.
The room was very large, you can imagine how large it must be for it to possess a table, large enough to host 20 people.
It was circular, and chairs were 0.2-0.3 meters apart from one another. Everything was classy in that room, even the windows.
The room was very lively. You could hear laughs and jokes being thrown all around it. Many were laughing and were expressing warm faces, smiling.
Others were taking this quite seriously and were talking about business or over-thinking things, such as how to approach the Godfather, how to explain this etc.
But something happened to that room. All of the Dons except 1 were in it and Tulio had yet to come.
The doors opened, gently, each door was opened by a silluethe like figure, they had resembling looks. They looked like
very bulky and tough human beings. Behind them was another figure, its presence radiating immense power and intimidation.
The man behind the 2 figures was tall, stylish, charming, yet his intimidation covered all of his charm.
Everyone stopped chattering, Toon was confused - who was he, why did everyone stop talking?
He also saw another detail, none were looking at the man behind the 2 figures, they were either minding their business or looking around him. Fruzier gently tapped him on his hand, signaling him to mimic what the others are doing.
The figure started walking like a prince towards his chair - it was 1 of the front chairs of the table.
On the other side of the table was another chair, which was Tulio's.
The 2 figures walked by his side, in a triangle shape. When the man was next to his chair, they went up infront, dragging the chair and helping the man sit. He sat as if he fell on the ground, making a slight noise.
His pose was that of a Godfather, cocky, powerful, intimidating, his hands were layed up infront of his table.
He did not look at anyone while entering and after sitting on the table, he just looked forward and then when he sat, he narrowed his eyes down to the table infront of him. You would not want to look in his eyes. Compared to anything you've felt when near this man, its nothing compared to starring him in his eyes - into his soul.
Toon got irritated that the man stopped the good mood in this room, and now everyone was acting as if on a funeral, so he decided to give him a gaze. Instantly one of the silluethe figures, eyes glowing blue looked intimidatingly at Toon, levitating his chair into the air, along with the whole table. Anything that was levitated, radiated a slight blue aura around its body. The chair was 1 meter up while the table was just 0.1-0.2
Other small items in the room also levitated. 4 of the dons stood up from their seats and started rambling about how this is wrong.
Fruzier could not take it so he looked at the mysterious Don who caused all this commotion, telling him that such behaviour is unnaceptable!
Instantly the second silluethe who was by the Don's side turned his attention towards Fruzier, his eyes glowed red and instantenously - Fruzier was found slammed on the wall behind him, his chair broken in two. Infront of him was The silluethe, whose fist was pummeling Fruzier's cheek to the wall.
4 other dons stood up and started protesting about the actions of the second silluethe.
Before the situation got more hectic, the mysterious Don rose his hand off the levitating table. All of the argues stopped, the Silluethes stopped their doings, while the waitress who was next to the back entrance was waiting for this moment to change the broken chair.
The Mysterious Don muttered:
- Leave us.
Both of the silluethes nodded and exited the room, while everyone else took their seats and were ever so silent.
The Don dropped his hand, his eyes ever so fixiated on the table infront of him.
Toon was unfazed throughout all these events - he wasn't hurt, but when he was in the air, his thoughts and mind almost went blank.
He could tell the silluethe was no show off and if he wanted to, he could damage him quite seriously.
He now understood that the man sitting there had immense power and started asking question he shouldn't ask.
"Why isn't he a Godfather?", " Why doesn't he rebel?".
He turned to Futon, twisting his neck towards his ear, asking him quietly about the man's name.
Don Futon about to answer, turned towards Toon, when the doors opened yet again.
It was none other than the Godfather himself.
- Ah, Don Spikes! I see you've made quite the commotion as usual! - he laughed, walking slowly while he talked towards 
the end of the room where his seat was.
Tulio rarely spoke names with their titles, but Don Spikes was one of the exceptions.
Don Twinx who was seated at the edge of the room joined the discussion, with an irritated face.
- You should discipline those gorillas and teach them some manners, Spikes. - her last words spoken in a skeptical voice. (Spikes's name)
- Twinx. - said with a calm and smooth voice Don Spikes.
- ..Do you want me to kill you?  - while saying that, his gaze finally and slowly lifted from the table, locking on the exquisite woman's face.
Just when Spikes looked her, a wind blew at Twinx's face, playing with her hair . Was that caused by his gaze or was it someone else? All the windows were locked.
She gritted her teeth and decided not to continue the topic.
Tulio's face bursted out some more laughs.
- Now.. - said the Godfather, tapping the table with both hands after taking his seat with the help of a servant in the house.
- Let us begin.
