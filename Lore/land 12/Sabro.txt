_- Don Sabro -_

Head of the Blue whales family
Located in Trove

Bio:
 Sabro was nobody at first. He had a very rough childhood. An uneducated, yet
moral young man. However, he is now a respectable Don of the land Trove,
who proved that there is no equal, Trove warrior, to him in terms of strength
and knowledge. He is here now entirely through his hard work and dedication.
He changed himself, educated himself and climbed the ladder, step by step, in Trove.
When Mano di Morde stepped in he was already the best. Tulio confronted him but
he willfully surrendered to him, without any bloodshed and offered to work under
his name, which Tulio found surprising - never had he seen such a peaceful,
yet powerful man. Tulio of course accepted the graceful offer.
 A calm child-like man, always positive and easy going, that is Sabro.  He doesn`t
like to talk much, but his every word means alot. He once had his eyes on lady
Twinx but gave up, learning that he was not the only man fighting for her heart -
even Tulio sends her flowers from time to time!
