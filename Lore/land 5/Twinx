_- Don Twinx - _

Head of the Odonata family
Located in the Bestia

Bio:
  Twinx a half-beast, half-woman is the most beautiful and most decieving of all the dons.
 She was the fourth one to claim a place as Don of Mano Di Morde and the first one to
 claim Tulio's heart. She was from the land of Bestia once known for its 3 large-scale
 quests and ultimately a land where 4 races were always at war. That is until Tulio came.
 It was just when the war was at one of its peaks. Of the four races ( Human, Beast-humans,
 Bio androids and Elrians) the Beast-humans had the most power and resources at the moment,
 but Tulio sent Spikes, the strongest Don, who put them under Tulio's command easily.
 At first Twinx didn't like the thought of being an underling of Mano Di Morde, but when
 Tulio and his troops dispatched the other races with ease and offered Twinx a place as a
 Don and a ruler of the land, (since she was the strongest, and he liked her) if she agreed
 to help them complete the 3 mythical quests. It was strange how Tulio knew how to complete
 those, since they were the legacy of the natives and a legend - none knew how to complete
 them! So Twinx could not miss her chance - she had to see the legends come true. So they
 passed the 3 quests, each residing in a strange magical place and each granting immense
 power through relics. Two of the relics were left with Twinx as she became a loyal Don and 
 one had gone to Spikes as he contributed most in the conquering...
 A beautiful woman with cat-ears a tail and tiger markings on her body, who could turn into
 a tiger at will - that was Twinx. Very charming and very secretive, she could hide her intentions
 from anyone with ease, maybe due to her sharp senses.
