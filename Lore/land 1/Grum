_- Don Grum -_

Leader of the battalion "Art-Illery"
Governor of Delta Horizon.

Bio:
  Grum is a very balky strongman. He lived in harsh times of constat wars & murders.
 He is a very tenacious and determined to achieve victory to the very bone.
 That is one of the reasons he asked the devil to help him - Tulio Benderoza.
 Tulio easily recruited men for Grum's cause - the command given entirely in Grum's hands.
 To Tulio's surprise, Grum made devastating results. His squad - very organized and reliable.
 Grum used strategies and formations that many minds thought to be crazy - they all reeked
 of a common feeling - deathwish -Grum's formations always invited death's door to everyone's necks, 
 including his own. But no matter the odds, his people never felt fear and persevered, or so they say.
 The land he was in was in tremendous turmoil and chaos and it could never be conquered or have a single
 ruler, unless there took place a mass genocide, so instead of taking it all, Grum with the help of Tulio,
 secured a small chunk of it, where the land's most feared elite battlesquad, the infantry battalion,
 known as "Art-Illery" by all, resided in. There were other nicknames of Grum's squad, influenced by
 their ordeals in that specific region: "Enflamed Artilleries", "Death Squad", "Tanks with no cannons" and
 "Sparkling Fuses".
