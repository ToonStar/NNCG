_- Don Iorin -_

Prince of Midnight Veil

Bio:
  Iorin was a man, too kind for his own good. In his childhood he always did his best to make
 everyone around him happy and content, even if it meant sacrificing his own money, space,
 peace of mind and whatnot. That played him badly, as there came a time when he snapped and
 turned into the polar opposite of what he was before. He did not care about anyone, he viewed
 humans as tools, which a proper man like himself can use to his own advantage. He knew that,
 because he was a tool before for many. He finally had gained clairvoyance to see it with his own
 eyes. To see how pitiful and stupid he was in his youth. The man Iorin you now know, resembles
 a lot to Tulio in terms of how they view the world, although Tulio never viewed humans as tools.
 He merely exploited them by using their mind. Though, none can say if he and Mano share the same
 feelings towards eachother. If Tulio somehow is exploiting Mano, then indeed he and Iorin are
 pretty much the same, although Iorin does not fake his expressions or gestures. He is always with
 this cold extinguished expression, as if he saw how the world ended. Never surprised, never amused,
 never laughing or expressing of emotion. A shell almost. He almost always speaks in the same tone
 of voice.
 Highly intelligent, his power and abilities - only a few have seen or heard about. At least they don't doubt his
 existance like Spikes, because there aren't any stories about him. He never liked the spotlight,
 giving credits he should recieve to his "tools", ever watching from the shadows - like a true mastermind.
 But he is certainly not raw power centered. If anything - he uses magic. After all, he is the Prince of
 the Midnight Veil - a place which is filled with mages and sorcerers, from the real deal!
